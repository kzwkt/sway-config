# sway-config

In this repo you'll find
  -my sway config (based on the one you get out of the box, just saying)
  -a script to display some useful information via swaybar (since waybar gets all the love and no one seems to care about swaybar)
  -some temporary files that are required to calculate the differences of certain values over time (eg .config/sway/status/.rx_bytes)

.config/sway/status/status.sh IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK OUT OF THE BOX!
There's AMD drivers required to extract the current cpu temperature. (For more details have a look at .config/sway/status/status.sh)
Owners of eg. an Intel cpu will have to do their own research on how to read from their thermal sensors.

Have a nice one!
